# Docblock downgrade rule — C / C++

Extensions: `.c .h .cpp .cc .cxx .hpp .hh .hxx`
Items: `function_definition`, `class_specifier`, `struct_specifier`.

- **Validated form**: a block comment beginning with `/**`. (Doxygen-style.)
- **Unvalidated form**: any block comment that does NOT begin with `/**` — typically `/* ... */`.
- Attachment: the comment immediately preceding the item, skipping `[[attribute]]` specifiers.

## When you edit an item's body, downgrade its docblock in the same Edit

Before:

    /**
     * Computes the area of a rectangle.
     */
    double area(const Rect& r) {
        return r.w * r.h;
    }

After (you changed the body, so downgrade in the SAME Edit):

    /*
     * Computes the area of a rectangle.
     */
    double area(const Rect& r) {
        return r.w * r.h * scale_factor();
    }

Rewrite: drop one star from the opening — `/**` becomes `/*`. The trailing `*/` is unchanged. The body of the comment is left alone (only the marker changes).

The hook rejects the Edit until both the body change and the marker downgrade appear in the same transaction.

## Write a docblock

A soft prose convention. The hook only enforces marker form; this section describes what to write *inside* an unvalidated `/* ... */` docblock.

### Functions / methods

1. One-line brief on the first line.
2. One line per parameter, `` `name`: ``, only what the parameter's name+type doesn't already convey.
3. One line `` `@return`: ``, only what the return type doesn't already convey.
4. One line (or more) of fine-grained performance modeling — complexity, hot-path notes, allocation pattern.
5. Lines end with ` \` as a visual continuation marker, except the last line.

Template:

    /* <one line brief> \
     * `a`: <description NOT covered by A's type> \
     * `out`: <description NOT covered by B's type> \
     * `@return`: <description NOT covered by return type> \
     * <fine-grained performance modeling>
     */
    bool method(A a, B& out);

Example:

    /* Compute the bounding box of a polygon \
     * `poly`: must be closed; behavior undefined for fewer than 3 vertices \
     * `out`: written iff `poly` is non-empty; untouched otherwise \
     * `@return`: false iff `poly` is empty \
     * O(n) over `poly.vertices.size()`; no heap allocation
     */
    bool bounding_box(const Polygon& poly, Rect& out);

### `struct` / `class`

1. One-line brief.
2. One line per field, `` `field_name`: ``, only what the field's name+type doesn't already convey.
3. Invariants the type maintains (if any).
4. Layout / size / alignment notes (where relevant).

Example:

    /* Fixed-capacity ring buffer of bytes \
     * `head`: read index, monotonically increasing modulo `cap` \
     * `tail`: write index; `head <= tail` at all times \
     * `buf`: storage; `cap` is a power of two so wrap is bitmasked \
     * Invariant: `tail - head <= cap` \
     * sizeof(RingBuf) == 32 on x86-64
     */
    struct RingBuf { uint32_t head, tail, cap; uint8_t* buf; };
